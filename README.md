# Election Project Polling Station Location
The task involved working on data mining, data cleaning, data preprocessing, 
data warehousing, and data storage in a database for a company project. 
Additionally, we developed a web app using Streamlit for a demo with the 
client. The objective was to create a system capable of fetching details of a 
specific user from an Elasticsearch server using either their EPIC ID or name.

• EPIC ID Search: If the user provided an EPIC ID, the system would display 
the corresponding user information.

• Name and Area Search: If the user entered a name and area, the system would 
present a list of names belonging to that area. Upon selecting a name from the 
list, the system would then display the user's information and provide further 
guidelines or instructions based on the retrieved personal information

Additionally, we included a "Get Direction" button, which allowed users to access 
Google Maps and view directions to the user's location based on the provided 
information.

# Election Project Election Analysis
For the Election Analysis project, my contribution included extracting data from 
the Election Commission's official website and downloading PDF files to the 
local system using Python tools.

• Tool 1: This tool downloaded all polling station-wise results from the election 
portal and saved them to the local computer.

• Tool 2: This tool converted the downloaded PDF files to Excel files, stored them 
in new folders, and performed data cleaning and preprocessing on these files.

• Tool 3: This tool processed the cleaned Excel files by dropping unwanted 
columns, preprocessing the data, converting it to JSON format, and storing the 
JSON files in a designated folder.
With the JSON files ready, they were then stored in a database for further analysis
